**When downloading, please make sure to go to the Files tab, and download the version for your modloader. The files have "fabric" or "forge" in their name. Curseforge doesn't always show the correct versions on the main page.**

This mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.

Unlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.

You can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.

The same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.
